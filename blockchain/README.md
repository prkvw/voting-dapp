## Overview

My Blockchain Dapp enables users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain by participating in a voting process for different candidates. Authorised Users can add candidates, and register voters. Voters can cast votes, and view the current vote count for each candidate.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Install Node.js to run and manage the dapp's development environment.

# Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository:**

   Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository to create your own copy.

2. Clone your forked repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voting-dapp.git
cd voting-dapp
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Configure Hardhat:

   Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your preferred Ethereum network and your private key for deploying contracts. 

   You can also the code below:

    ```sh
    cp .env_example .env
    ```
5. Create a package - Initialise node package manager.
    ```sh
    npm init
    ```
6. Compile the contracts:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

6. Run the tests:

```sh
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```

7. Deploy the contracts to the blockchain:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai
```

## Usage

1. Connect to the Ethereum network using a wallet like MetaMask.

2. Interact with the dapp through a command line, a synced blockchain explorer, or integrate with your own front-end application.

3. # Contract Functionality

    -   Register Voter
    -   Store Candidates
    -   Track If Voter has Already Voted
    -   Add New Candidate
    -   Retrieves All Candidates for Viewing
    -   Allows Voter to Cast immutable Vote for one Candidate only

# Known Issues
 There are two versions of voting contracts in this project. Tests were written for first version, and labelled for that specific contract. Running both tests simultaneously will present results for both versions asynchronously.
